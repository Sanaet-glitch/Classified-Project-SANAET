## Introduction

This is a sample blog post written in MDX.

MDX allows you to use JSX components within your Markdown content.

```javascript
console.log('Hello, MDX!');
```

Here's some **bold text** and *italic text*.

> This is a blockquote.

Let's try a simple component (assuming you define one later):

{/* <MyComponent /> */}
